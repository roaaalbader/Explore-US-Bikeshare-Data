# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

This is the second project in Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program in Udacity.

## Overview
This project is about exploring the US bikeshare data in three major cities the United States Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.
Using python the data was imported and questions was answered using descriptive statistics.

## Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration
- Start Station
- End Statio
- User Type)

Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

## Statistics Computed
In this project, I have write a code to provide the following information:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

4. User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Data Files
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
